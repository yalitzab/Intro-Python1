### Sarah buys 3 apples at $1.50 each and 2 bananas at $0.75 each.
### She also has to pay a flat bag fee of $1. Calculate her total cost.
# apple_cost = 1.50
# num_apples = 3
# banana_cost = 0.75
# num_bananas = 2
# bag_fee = 1
#
# total_apple_cost = apple_cost * num_apples
# total_banana_cost = banana_cost * num_bananas
# total_cost = total_apple_cost + total_banana_cost + bag_fee
# # grand_total = (apple_cost * num_apples) + (banana_cost * num_bananas) + bag_fee
# print ("Total cost is $", total_cost)
